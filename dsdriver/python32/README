README for the IBM_DB Driver and IBM_DB_DBI Wrapper
===================================================
The IBM_DB driver and IBM_DB_DBI Wrapper provides Python interface that enables any application in the Python environment to interact with IBM data servers. The wrapper conforms to the DBI specification located at: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/

The extensions available with this DB2 package might be of a lower version as compared to the one available on the community. It is recommended that you download the latest driver/wrapper available on the PYPI page of IBM_DB (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibm_db) or Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/ibm-db/), as it might contain important fixes and new features.
